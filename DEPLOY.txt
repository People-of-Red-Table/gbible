If it is your first deploy read INSTALL.txt for instructions.

Before deploy check the site, commit and only then deploy. [or code can be lost during copying to remote server, for example, messed up with tabs FTP and files]

`header.php` checks for file `deployment_flag.txt` and if it exists script warns visitors about maintenance work on the site.
It is not a flag variable in the config, because flag can be forgotten. Flag file - you will see.

During deploying watch changes at `git status` [in saved file] and copy these files to the server [if you didn't commit yet].
Use `git add .` and deploy.

Files in caps [Caps Lock] must not go to the web server.

Be sure that you updated `config.php` on remote server if it was changed [This file is untracked, for repository there is `config.sample.php`, which must not be copied to web server files].

You can warn users about maintenance work.

Be sure that new tables are created on the remote database server.

Check changes before deploy. Check the site after deploy. Is it working?

Current server is on free [!] hosting, so, it is not so fast and sometimes web server gives its "500"... And speed of copying is not much, cause project is on Free account [FTP and Web].

But "we" PoRT [or me =] are grateful, cause it is not easy to find good free hosting with PHP and SQL.

If countries ad languages updated and you need list of Bibles for all countries execute this query:
`
