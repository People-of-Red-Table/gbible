If it is your first deploy read INSTALL.txt for instructions.

During deploying watch changes at `git status` and copy these files to the server [if you didn't commit yet].
Use `git add .` and deploy.
Files in caps [Caps Lock] must not go to the web server.

Be sure that you updated `config.php` on remote server if it was changed [This file is untracked, for repository there is `config.sample.php`].

You can warn users about maintenance work.

Be sure that new tables are created on the remote database server.

Check changes before deploy. Check the site after deploy. Is it working?
Current server is on free [!] hosting, so, it is not so fast and sometimes web server gives its errors.

But "we" PoRT [or me =] are grateful, cause it is not easy to find good free hosting with PHP and SQL.
