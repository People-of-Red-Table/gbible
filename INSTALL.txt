To deploy site you need to create two databases: 
`gbible` - main base of site, 
`sofia` - base of scriptures.

In ./install/ directory you can find scripts for setting up database.

php directory must be set in PATH variable [for Windows right click on your computer [or Windows + Pause/Break] -> Properties,.. and somewhere on tabs there "Environment Variables" -> Variables of System -> PATH -> Edit].


=====================
1. Install VPL Bibles
=====================

Download all *_vpl.zip files from http://ebible.org/Scriptures/. File `urls.txt` contains links for these VPL. You can use Internet Download Accelerator - Download Master. All archives must be unpacked in its own directory `./*_vpl/`. All scripts must be in directory with these VPL.

Prepare Portuguese translation if you are deploying into public server. You can get text VPL on https://github.com/blivre/BibliaLivre/releases. Download there file `bliv-tr_vpl.txt`. And rename and put it to `pt_bliv_vpl`.
Run `php -f make_sql.php pt_bliv_vpl`.

If during installing Bibles you've exception, it could be because there is no `*_vpl.sql` file.
You can make this SQL script by command:
Run `php -f make_sql.php *_vpl`.
Required file `*_vpl.txt`


=============================
2. Install John Hurt's Bibles
=============================

John Hurt's Bibles are Bibles from site http://htmlbible.com/ or http://johnhurt.com/.
Download ZIP archives of necessary languages and put them to `./bibles/` directory.
URL list: `urls.txt` for archives.
If you are on the linux or have access or Cygwin on Windows you can download by `wget` other Bibles from `http_bibles.txt`:
`wget --recursive % --domains % --no-parent --page-requisites --html-extension --convert-links --restrict-file-names --no-clobber`
or:
`wget -m %URL%`
For Windows [without cygwin] use: HTTrack: https://www.httrack.com/

To unpack ZIP archives use command:
`php -f unpack_archives.php` for a server with unlimited time for script execution.
Or if you are running it from limited web server [with no SSH or any other remote access]:
`%SITE_URL%/install/unpack_archive.php?&file=%NAME_OF_ARCHIVE%`.
Or if you have direct access to the files - just use any ZIP utility.

Bibles which are not in archive must be added "AS IS" with links to external web site.

All external and Bibles from `./bibles/` must be added through phpMyAdmin interface into table `b_shelf`.


======================
3. Database deployment
======================

1. To run it use this command: 
php -f prepare.php
If during these script you've got a "stop" at a VPL, possibly it's because there is no SQL file. Run `php -f make_sql.php %translation_name_vpl%`. This script will make `*_vpl.sql` file.
To continue on specific VPL type `php -f prepare.php name_vpl` and script will skip all previous translations and will start from `name_vpl`.
2. Then in PHPMyAdmin or other database view run script sofia.sql.
3. Site shall be available at your address [http://127.0.0.1/ for local machine],
if it doesn't show Bible texts - run directly update commands for Bible database:
php -f just_prepare_sql.php
If you have got issue with languages, for example, in Microsoft table of languages, there is no Angola with Portuguese. This function is doing `./install/add_languages.php`, it is already included to `./prepare.php`. If anyway you still having it, try to run this script.

-------------------------
3.1 Multi-Language Titles
-------------------------

Installation directory has script `make_titles.php` which scans current directory and looks there for folders with InScript or "_html" Bibles, it needs only main index HTML file [`index.html` for InScript and `index.htm` for "_html" from eBible.org].
From these HTML files script extracts titles and inserts it to the database.

If script has got REQUEST argument `dir`, it looks for titles in `./{$dir}/`.
If you run it from command line: `php -f make_titles.php` you can add there directory too: `php -f make_titles.php English`.
