Other Timetables
----------------

+ schedule reading on the page of Bibles.

+ Bible has around 1189 chapters, which is three and quarter chapters per a day.

+ User timetables like: one chapter per a day, or one[few] chapter[s] per Saturday/Sunday.

- two different types of timetables: timed to Holidays and not timed, warn about capacity: 8 chapters for a week.
	
for gospels - 89 chapters
NT after gospels: 171 chapter - ~33 weeks
OT - 929 chapters

e.g. 3 chapters for each weekend day [Saturday - 3 chapters, Sunday - 3 chapters]:

~89 chapters for a days from Christmas to Easter which is impossible with capacity of 72 chapters.
so - minimum 8 chapters for a week. And in this case no reading except gospels between Christmas and Easter.

+ Timetable for Parallel Bibles.
