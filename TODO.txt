When will be internet:
change links for bibles to gold-bible.16mb.com/bibles/
there must be many unpacked Bibles
Run HTTrack to download rest of Bibles of John Hurt
and upload them to ./bibles/
Check which are not in ./bibles/, e.g. Dutch Bible.
This is very need for Search Engines to make them think that Bibles are in gold-bible.16mb.com.

Make .has-success .has-feedback etc things for controls during content checking.

Merge Bibles with InScript and John Hurt's to display it in <iframe /> for such languages as Italian, Dutch etc.
Because PoRT don't have these Bibles in SQL or VPL format... And there is no other way at that moment unless just show them in <iframe>...
