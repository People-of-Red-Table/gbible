			<p align="justify" style="font-size: 0.7em">In February of 2015 this company bided project of Bible Site at <a href="http://www.freelancer.com" target="_blank">Freelancer.com</a>. They [Boon Info Tect] took in advance 3 368 USD, then he made up a reason and declined to work on this project with insulting. Discussions show that he just made up this reason to take the money and don't finish work. I filmed a bunch of videos and put it to the public, wrote to support of Freelancer.com. Boon Info Tech manager[or director] - Boon - was hiding first days and support thought that he just has an issue with Internet. His page on Freelancer.com at that moment was "closed". In June in fear of something he said in <a href="http://basecamp.com/" target="_blank">Basecamp</a> that he will continue work on Bible Site. But it was just a lie. Boon Info Tech didn't continue work on site.</p>
            <p align="justify">At that moment their company is ignoring messages from me to their mailboxes. They didn't finish work on new Bible Site and didn't return payment. Videos on Microsoft account are waiting for a court order.</p>
